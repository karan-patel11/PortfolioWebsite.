            <p>
              A Computer Science masterâ€™s student with 2+ years of hands-on engineering experience, Iâ€™ve shipped fintech products, solved real-world business problems, and launched my own tech venture. My track record proves I can design, build, and scale robust systemsâ€”delivering fresh ideas and real value from day one.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>
              Iâ€™m happiest building things people actually use: code review tools powered by GPT, food-delivery apps loved by customersâ€”even AI that spots disease in medical scans or environmental hazards from satellite data. Whether Iâ€™m solving a tricky backend challenge or pushing the latest in deep learning, I focus on practical, scalable solutions that make a differenceâ€”for teams, businesses, and everyday users. If you want someone who blends technical depth with real-world hustle, letâ€™s connect.

            <p>
              Me and my partner Chintan Ruperal noticed how the younger generation struggles with financial literacy and often falls prey to "get rich quick" schemes. To combat this, we launched TWODS CAPITALâ€”a platform aimed at financial education and responsible investing. We hosted educational webinars, collaborated with platforms like Algobulls, and began building a community-driven finance brand. Thatâ€™s how TWODS CAPITAL was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              FinTech has always been my passion and inspiration. At TWODS CAPITAL, we focus on data-driven investing, ethical strategy building, and community-first values. Our mission is to empower the next generation with knowledge and tools to invest confidently, responsibly, and with impact.

                In my role supporting the Law Schoolâ€™s technology infrastructure, I ensure every event, class, and presentation runs smoothlyâ€”managing multimedia systems, troubleshooting technical issues in real time, and proactively solving problems before they disrupt operations. My daily work sharpens my ability to deliver high-availability services, maintain robust system performance, and respond quickly to unexpected technical challengesâ€”skills that directly translate to engineering reliable, zero-downtime applications and platforms. By collaborating closely with faculty, students, and IT teams, I also refine my cross-functional communication and user-focused problem-solving, understanding exactly how technology needs to perform for real-world users. Working in the media center further develops my hands-on experience with backend systems, technical documentation, and process automation, all of which are essential in both software engineering and AI/ML deployment.

                At GWU as a Research Assistant, I designed and developed a scalable AI-powered code checking and exam testing system that leverages large language modelsâ€”including GPT, CodeBERT, and CodeT5â€”to automatically review student code submissions in real time. My work included building Python-based REST APIs, automating the grading pipeline with CI/CD, and deploying the service on the cloud with Docker and Kubernetesâ€”ensuring high reliability, over 95% error-detection accuracy, and minimal deployment downtime. I also implemented unit and integration tests, monitored system performance, and iterated on features based on direct feedback from both students and faculty. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack engineering, applied machine learning, and cloud infrastructure, while also seeing real impact on how instructors teach and students learn. My dual focus on both technical excellence and real-world usability helped create a system thatâ€™s both powerful and truly helpful in the classroom.

                I spent a year at VE as both a Software Development Engineer and a Business Solution Analyst, leading the design, development, and deployment of cloud-based web and mobile platforms with Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, and Kubernetes. I delivered REST APIs, microservices, and robust CI/CD pipelinesâ€”driving feature launches, automated testing, and reliable incident response. Working closely with product and ops teams, I balanced engineering rigor with business insight: leveraging ML/AI to build predictive analytics for inventory, NLP chatbots to automate customer support, and dashboards that turned raw data into actionable decisions. I also led user interviews, gathered feedback, and mentored junior engineersâ€”ensuring our code was clean, scalable, and genuinely valuable to both the business and its customers. By the end of my tenure, our team had accelerated critical workflows, delivered intelligent product features, and left a codebase and culture built for future growth.
